It takes a village to enable a city of contributors doing what they do best. There are a lot of fun stories and lessons to be shared from helping out the community. One lesson is taken straight from the Kubernetes project itself: declarative config management. Most aspects of the community are managed using declarative configs. Adding a new SIG, GitHub org member, and even Slack channel, involves updating and PRing a change into one of the many Kubernetes repos.</description></item><item><title>Ansible, Integration Testing, and You.</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2017-07-26-ansible-integration-testing-and-you/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2017-07-26-ansible-integration-testing-and-you/</guid><description>Ansible is quickly becoming one of, if not the most prevalent Configuration Management tools. It&amp;rsquo;s rapid growth however, is not mirrored in the tooling and processes to test and validate Ansible&amp;rsquo;s roles or playbooks. Thankfully, these tools exist in other communities, and can be easily adapted. This talk covers everything needed to get started with writing, integrating and automating these tests both locally and in AWS using a suite of common frameworks borrowed from the chef community: Test-Kitchen and ServerSpec.</description></item><item><title>CNCF Research User Group KubeConNA 2019</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-11-20-cncf-research-user-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-11-20-cncf-research-user-group/</guid><description>This session is open to those interested in running Kubernetes and cloud native platforms in a research context.

They have historically been constrained to supporting classic “job” style workloads. With the growth of new workflow practices such as streaming data, science gateways, and more “dynamic” research using lambda-like functions, they must now support a variety of workloads.
In this talk, Lindsey and Bob will discuss some difficulties faced by academic institutions and how Kubernetes offers an extensible solution to support the future of research.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes: The Next Research Platform</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-03-13-kubernetes-the-next-research-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-03-13-kubernetes-the-next-research-platform/</guid><description>Kubernetes has become the defacto standard as a platform for container orchestration. Its ease of extending and many integrations has paved the way for a wide variety of data science and research tooling to be built on top of it.
From all encompassing tools like Kubeflow that make it easy for researchers to build end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines to specific orchestration of analytics engines such as Spark; Kubernetes has made the deployment and management of these things easy.</description></item><item><title>Managing Research Needs at the University of Michigan using Kubernetes (podcast)</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2020-02-04-managing-research-needs-at-the-university-of-michigan-using-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2020-02-04-managing-research-needs-at-the-university-of-michigan-using-kubernetes/</guid><description>Managing Research Needs at the University of Michigan using Kubernetes with Bob Killen
Keeping with our KubeCon theme, we caught up with Bob at the event to discuss how his group at UM is deploying Kubernetes. In our conversation, we explore the user experience of his broad user base, including those using KubeFlow environments, and how those users are taking advantage of distributed computing. We also discuss if ML/AI focused Kubernetes users should fear that the larger non-ML/AI user base will negatively impact their feature needs, where the largest gaps currently exist in trying to support these ML/AI users’ workloads, where Bob sees things going from a user perspective, and what are the things those users are asking about most?</description></item><item><title>Meeting HPC Container Challenges as a Community</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-11-13-meeting-hpc-container-challenges-as-a-community/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-11-13-meeting-hpc-container-challenges-as-a-community/</guid><description>Containers increase the likelihood users can run the latest version of HPC applications in their data center, because it&amp;rsquo;s easier for administrators to install them and developers to deploy them. But we need to build and leverage an active community to solve remaining challenges.
