      <title>Ansible, Integration Testing, and You.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible is quickly becoming one of, if not the most prevalent Configuration Management tools. It&amp;rsquo;s rapid growth
however, is not mirrored in the tooling and processes to test and validate Ansible&amp;rsquo;s roles or playbooks. Thankfully,
these tools exist in other communities, and can be easily adapted. This talk covers everything needed to get started
with writing, integrating and automating these tests both locally and in AWS using a suite of common frameworks borrowed
from the chef community: Test-Kitchen and ServerSpec.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtualization and containers have grown to see more prominent use within the realm of HPC. Adoption of these tools has enabled IT Organizations to reduce costs while making it easier to manage large pools of compute, storage and networking resources. However, performance overheads, networking integrations, and system complexity pose daunting architectural challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack, Docker, Charliecloud, Singularity, Kubernetes, and Mesos all pose their own set of unique benefits and challenges. This Birds of a Feather is aimed at architects, administrators, software engineers, and scientists interested in designing and deploying cloud infrastructure solutions to run HPC workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2nd session of the Beginner Track of the Saturday Workshop. This hour and a half session serves and an introduction
to Kubernetes, it&amp;rsquo;s core components, and will finish up by touching upon Workloads. This is an interactive session and
attendees should come prepared with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;minikube&lt;/a&gt; installed. Attendees should
come away with a good understanding of the basics and grasp next steps for continuing their Kubernetes journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Kubernetes Workshop (Full-Day)</title>
      <link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-10-15-introduction-to-kubernetes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Containers have shifted the way applications are packaged and delivered. Their use with cloud oriented services, data
science and machine-learning is skyrocketing with the beneficial side effect of enabling reproducible research. This
rise in use has necessitated the need to explore and adopt better container-centric orchestration tools. Of these
tools, Kubernetes - an open-source container platform born within Google &amp;ndash; has become the de-facto standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes API-driven, highly extensible design has lead to its adoption by numerous vendors and projects. Powering the
likes of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Redhat, it has truly delivered a single, platform agnostic API for managing
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this tutorial is to introduce those application architects, developers, and system administrators who may
already be familiar with container concepts to the architecture of Kubernetes. Through a series of lectures and
hands-on exercises, attendees will explore the many facets of working in a Kubernetes environment. These exercises will
be augmented with discussions and demonstrations of various practical application deployments, with the goal of
attendees being able to come away from the tutorial with the knowledge to begin to consume Kubernetes as a platform for
their own programs and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes API-driven, highly extensible design has lead to its adoption by numerous vendors and projects. IBM,
JupyterHub, Spark, Pachyderm, kubeflow, and many other tools boast native methods of integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this half-day tutorial is to introduce those researchers and sys admins who may already be familiar with
container concepts to the architecture and fundamental concepts of Kubernetes. Attendees will explore these concepts
through a series of hands-on exercises and leave with the leg-up in continuing their container education, and gain a
better understanding of how Kubernetes may be used for research applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-05-04-kubeconeu-office-hours-live/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This session is a live office hours session about Kubernetes. We will have a panel of Kubernetes developers available
for you to ask questions and have them answered live for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Office Hours is a live stream where we answer live questions about Kubernetes from users on the YouTube channel.
Office hours are a regularly scheduled meeting where people can bring topics to discuss with the greater community.
They are great for answering questions, getting feedback on how youâ€™re using Kubernetes, or to just passively learn by
following along.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/office-hours.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Office Hours Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kubernetes: The Next Research Platform</title>
      <link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-03-13-kubernetes-the-next-research-platform/</link>

      <guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-03-13-kubernetes-the-next-research-platform/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has become the defacto standard as a platform for container orchestration. Its ease of extending and many integrations has paved the way for a wide variety of data science and research tooling to be built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all encompassing tools like Kubeflow that make it easy for researchers to build end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines to specific orchestration of analytics engines such as Spark; Kubernetes has made the deployment and management of these things easy. This presentation will showcase some of the larger research tools in the ecosystem and go into how Kubernetes has enabled this easy form of application management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meeting HPC Container Challenges as a Community</title>
      <link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-11-13-meeting-hpc-container-challenges-as-a-community/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Containers increase the likelihood users can run the latest version of HPC applications in their data center, because it&amp;rsquo;s easier for administrators to install them and developers to deploy them. But we need to build and leverage an active community to solve remaining challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BoF presents, prioritizes, and gathers further input on top issues and budding solutions around containerization of HPC applications. Lightning talks nominated in ongoing community discussions describe the community&amp;rsquo;s top issues, frame challenges, highlight progress and plans. Led discussions expand on the seeded issues, enumerate additional problems, and draw the audience into our ongoing community-wide forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; unlisted panelist)&lt;/p&gt;
