      <title>Ansible, Integration Testing, and You.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible is quickly becoming one of, if not the most prevalent Configuration Management tools. It&amp;rsquo;s rapid growth
however, is not mirrored in the tooling and processes to test and validate Ansible&amp;rsquo;s roles or playbooks. Thankfully,
these tools exist in other communities, and can be easily adapted. This talk covers everything needed to get started
with writing, integrating and automating these tests both locally and in AWS using a suite of common frameworks borrowed
from the chef community: Test-Kitchen and ServerSpec.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An overview of Kubernetes Federation, it&amp;rsquo;s research and scientific applications, and how the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://slateci.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SLATE&lt;/a&gt; project intends to tackle them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2nd session of the Beginner Track of the Saturday Workshop. This hour and a half session serves and an introduction
to Kubernetes, it&amp;rsquo;s core components, and will finish up by touching upon Workloads. This is an interactive session and
attendees should come prepared with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;minikube&lt;/a&gt; installed. Attendees should
come away with a good understanding of the basics and grasp next steps for continuing their Kubernetes journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Kubernetes Workshop (Full-Day)</title>
      <link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018_10_i2techex/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Containers have shifted the way applications are packaged and delivered. Their use with cloud oriented services, data
science and machine-learning is skyrocketing with the beneficial side effect of enabling reproducible research. This
rise in use has necessitated the need to explore and adopt better container-centric orchestration tools. Of these
tools, Kubernetes - an open-source container platform born within Google &amp;ndash; has become the de-facto standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes API-driven, highly extensible design has lead to its adoption by numerous vendors and projects. Powering the
likes of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Redhat, it has truly delivered a single, platform agnostic API for managing
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this tutorial is to introduce those application architects, developers, and system administrators who may
already be familiar with container concepts to the architecture of Kubernetes. Through a series of lectures and
hands-on exercises, attendees will explore the many facets of working in a Kubernetes environment. These exercises will
be augmented with discussions and demonstrations of various practical application deployments, with the goal of
attendees being able to come away from the tutorial with the knowledge to begin to consume Kubernetes as a platform for
their own programs and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes API-driven, highly extensible design has lead to its adoption by numerous vendors and projects. IBM,
JupyterHub, Spark, Pachyderm, kubeflow, and many other tools boast native methods of integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this half-day tutorial is to introduce those researchers and sys admins who may already be familiar with
container concepts to the architecture and fundamental concepts of Kubernetes. Attendees will explore these concepts
through a series of hands-on exercises and leave with the leg-up in continuing their container education, and gain a
better understanding of how Kubernetes may be used for research applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KubeconEU: Office Hours Live!</title>
      <link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018_05_kubeconeu/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This session is a live office hours session about Kubernetes. We will have a panel of Kubernetes developers available
for you to ask questions and have them answered live for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Office Hours is a live stream where we answer live questions about Kubernetes from users on the YouTube channel.
Office hours are a regularly scheduled meeting where people can bring topics to discuss with the greater community.
They are great for answering questions, getting feedback on how youâ€™re using Kubernetes, or to just passively learn by
following along.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/office-hours.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Office Hours Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
