It takes a village to enable a city of contributors doing what they do best. There are a lot of fun stories and lessons to be shared from helping out the community. One lesson is taken straight from the Kubernetes project itself: declarative config management. Most aspects of the community are managed using declarative configs. Adding a new SIG, GitHub org member, and even Slack channel, involves updating and PRing a change into one of the many Kubernetes repos. Adopting this methodology provides the community the means to self-manage itself. Join us as we journey through the many bits of community automation and weigh the merits of automating every aspect of our community.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ansible, Integration Testing, and You.</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2017-07-26-ansible-integration-testing-and-you/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2017-07-26-ansible-integration-testing-and-you/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible is quickly becoming one of, if not the most prevalent Configuration Management tools. It&amp;rsquo;s rapid growth
however, is not mirrored in the tooling and processes to test and validate Ansible&amp;rsquo;s roles or playbooks. Thankfully,
these tools exist in other communities, and can be easily adapted. This talk covers everything needed to get started
with writing, integrating and automating these tests both locally and in AWS using a suite of common frameworks borrowed
from the chef community: Test-Kitchen and ServerSpec.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CNCF Research User Group KubeConNA 2019</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-11-20-cncf-research-user-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-11-20-cncf-research-user-group/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This session is open to those interested in running Kubernetes and cloud native platforms in a research context.

Their use with cloud oriented services, data
science and machine-learning is skyrocketing with the beneficial side effect of enabling reproducible research. This
rise in use has necessitated the need to explore and adopt better container-centric orchestration tools. Of these
tools, Kubernetes - an open-source container platform born within Google &amp;ndash; has become the de-facto standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes API-driven, highly extensible design has lead to its adoption by numerous vendors and projects. Powering the
likes of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Redhat, it has truly delivered a single, platform agnostic API for managing
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this tutorial is to introduce those application architects, developers, and system administrators who may
already be familiar with container concepts to the architecture of Kubernetes. Through a series of lectures and
hands-on exercises, attendees will explore the many facets of working in a Kubernetes environment. These exercises will
be augmented with discussions and demonstrations of various practical application deployments, with the goal of
attendees being able to come away from the tutorial with the knowledge to begin to consume Kubernetes as a platform for
their own programs and services.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Kubernetes Workshop (Half-Day)</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-11-11-introduction-to-kubernetes-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-11-11-introduction-to-kubernetes-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Containers have shifted the way applications are packaged and delivered.

They have historically been constrained to supporting classic “job” style workloads. With the growth of new workflow practices such as streaming data, science gateways, and more “dynamic” research using lambda-like functions, they must now support a variety of workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Lindsey and Bob will discuss some difficulties faced by academic institutions and how Kubernetes offers an extensible solution to support the future of research. They will present a selection of projects currently benefiting from Kubernetes enabled tools, like Argo, Kubeflow, and kube-batch. These workflows will be demonstrated using specific examples from two large research institutions: Compute Canada, Canada’s national computation research consortium and the University of Michigan, one of the largest public Universities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes: The Next Research Platform</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-03-13-kubernetes-the-next-research-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-03-13-kubernetes-the-next-research-platform/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has become the defacto standard as a platform for container orchestration. Its ease of extending and many integrations has paved the way for a wide variety of data science and research tooling to be built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all encompassing tools like Kubeflow that make it easy for researchers to build end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines to specific orchestration of analytics engines such as Spark; Kubernetes has made the deployment and management of these things easy. This presentation will showcase some of the larger research tools in the ecosystem and go into how Kubernetes has enabled this easy form of application management.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Managing Research Needs at the University of Michigan using Kubernetes (podcast)</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2020-02-04-managing-research-needs-at-the-university-of-michigan-using-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2020-02-04-managing-research-needs-at-the-university-of-michigan-using-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-344-managing-research-needs-at-the-university-of-michigan-using-kubernetes-w-bob-killen/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Managing Research Needs at the University of Michigan using Kubernetes with Bob Killen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping with our KubeCon theme, we caught up with Bob at the event to discuss how his group at UM is deploying Kubernetes. In our conversation, we explore the user experience of his broad user base, including those using KubeFlow environments, and how those users are taking advantage of distributed computing. We also discuss if ML/AI focused Kubernetes users should fear that the larger non-ML/AI user base will negatively impact their feature needs, where the largest gaps currently exist in trying to support these ML/AI users’ workloads, where Bob sees things going from a user perspective, and what are the things those users are asking about most?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
