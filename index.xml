It takes a village to enable a city of contributors doing what they do best. There are a lot of fun stories and lessons to be shared from helping out the community. One lesson is taken straight from the Kubernetes project itself: declarative config management. Most aspects of the community are managed using declarative configs. Adding a new SIG, GitHub org member, and even Slack channel, involves updating and PRing a change into one of the many Kubernetes repos. Adopting this methodology provides the community the means to self-manage itself. Join us as we journey through the many bits of community automation and weigh the merits of automating every aspect of our community.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ansible, Integration Testing, and You.</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2017-07-26-ansible-integration-testing-and-you/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2017-07-26-ansible-integration-testing-and-you/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible is quickly becoming one of, if not the most prevalent Configuration Management tools. It&amp;rsquo;s rapid growth
however, is not mirrored in the tooling and processes to test and validate Ansible&amp;rsquo;s roles or playbooks. Thankfully,
these tools exist in other communities, and can be easily adapted. This talk covers everything needed to get started
with writing, integrating and automating these tests both locally and in AWS using a suite of common frameworks borrowed
from the chef community: Test-Kitchen and ServerSpec.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CNCF Research User Group KubeConNA 2019</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-11-20-cncf-research-user-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2019-11-20-cncf-research-user-group/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This session is open to those interested in running Kubernetes and cloud native platforms in a research context.

Their use with cloud oriented services, data
science and machine-learning is skyrocketing with the beneficial side effect of enabling reproducible research. This
rise in use has necessitated the need to explore and adopt better container-centric orchestration tools. Of these
tools, Kubernetes - an open-source container platform born within Google &amp;ndash; has become the de-facto standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes API-driven, highly extensible design has lead to its adoption by numerous vendors and projects. Powering the
likes of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Redhat, it has truly delivered a single, platform agnostic API for managing
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this tutorial is to introduce those application architects, developers, and system administrators who may
already be familiar with container concepts to the architecture of Kubernetes. Through a series of lectures and
hands-on exercises, attendees will explore the many facets of working in a Kubernetes environment. These exercises will
be augmented with discussions and demonstrations of various practical application deployments, with the goal of
attendees being able to come away from the tutorial with the knowledge to begin to consume Kubernetes as a platform for
their own programs and services.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Kubernetes Workshop (Half-Day)</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-11-11-introduction-to-kubernetes-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-11-11-introduction-to-kubernetes-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Containers have shifted the way applications are packaged and delivered.

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes API-driven, highly extensible design has lead to its adoption by numerous vendors and projects. IBM,
JupyterHub, Spark, Pachyderm, kubeflow, and many other tools boast native methods of integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this half-day tutorial is to introduce those researchers and sys admins who may already be familiar with
container concepts to the architecture and fundamental concepts of Kubernetes. Attendees will explore these concepts
through a series of hands-on exercises and leave with the leg-up in continuing their container education, and gain a
better understanding of how Kubernetes may be used for research applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Supply Chain Security Tooling</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2022-08-02-introduction-to-supply-chain-security-tooling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2022-08-02-introduction-to-supply-chain-security-tooling/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;You’re familiar with containers and Kubernetes, but suddenly people are talking
about supply chains, and you’re pretty sure they don’t mean the Suez Canal. Join
Jeffrey Sica and Bob Killen for an in-depth look at the nuts, bolts, and
metaphorical shipping containers that make up modern container supply chain
security. They’ll demo sigstore and show how container signing automation works
with Kubernetes. You’ll leave prepared to make decisions that will keep your
org unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;

While most things start with
Kubernetes as a foundation, a stack can vary wildly, even when sticking only to
CNCF-accepted projects. In addition to the technical aspects, there’s also
community, docs, and governance to be aware of when looking to contribute
(and often even consume) these technologies. Never fear, for Bob Killen
(Google) and Jeffrey Sica (CNCF) are here to provide attendees a map of the
land(scape). Both have been active consumers of, and contributors to, CNCF
projects for years. In this talk, Bob and Jeff will guide attendees through what
a Cloud Native stack looks like, the common problems that different projects
look to solve, and how Community plays a big part in this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, both have also been residents of Southeastern Michigan for most
of their lives! Therefore the talk will be chalked full of analogies to Detroit
Style Pizza, Coney Dogs, and Automobiles to celebrate their home state and the
wonderful city of Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>KubeconEU: Office Hours Live!</title><link>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-05-04-kubeconeu-office-hours-live/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrbobbytabl.es/talk/2018-05-04-kubeconeu-office-hours-live/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This session is a live office hours session about Kubernetes. We will have a panel of Kubernetes developers available
for you to ask questions and have them answered live for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
